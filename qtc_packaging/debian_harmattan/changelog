    entered all over again every time upon connection

    window if some other client connected to the same psyBNC instance
    requests it
  * Fixed issue #7: Option to disable auto-connect on application start

    is incompatible with previous versions -> connections must be
    re-entered. This is no more necessary in the future when stored
    settings change, thanks to the versioning...
